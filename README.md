# My ToDo List

I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a simple and practical task manager. One of the key features I incorporated is the concept of local storage, ensuring that users' tasks remain saved even when they close the page. Additionally, I introduced buttons such as "All," "Pending," "Completed," and "Deleted." Using JavaScript, these buttons enable users to filter tasks based on their preferences, enhancing the user experience and providing flexibility in task organization.

Creating this project has been a great learning experience for me as a beginner. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of dynamic interactions, event handling, and DOM manipulation in Javascript. The practical implementation of local storage provided hands-on experience in data persistence across sessions. Additionally, incorporating buttons for task filtering increased my knowledge of user interactivity and JavaScript functions. Furthermore, creating this project also increased my understanding of how CSS is used in styling and ensuring interface responsiveness.
